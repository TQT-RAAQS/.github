We are a research group in experimental quantum physics at the Institute for Quantum Computing at the University of Waterloo in Canada. Our goal is to advance quantum science and technology through innovation and collaboration. Our key expertise is designing, building, and operating quantum processors based on configurations of atoms in arrays of optical traps.
